\section*{1. Project Overview}

This project is a console-based, multi-player dice game developed in Java. The core objective was to apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and robust data management techniques to build a structured, reliable, and easily expandable gaming system. The project specifically focuses on creating modular components for clear separation of concerns.

\section*{2. Technical Architecture and OOP Principles}

The system architecture is strictly modular and adheres to core OOP principles:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Modular Design and Encapsulation:} The system is decomposed into highly specialized classes (\texttt{Player}, \texttt{Dice}, \texttt{GameEngine}), ensuring low coupling and high cohesion. Encapsulation is enforced to protect the integrity of game state data.
    \item \textbf{Game Logic Management:} The \texttt{GameEngine} class houses all complex logic, including simultaneous dice rolls, winner determination, and tie-breaking rules (no win awarded in a tie).
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Data Structures:} A \texttt{List<Player>} is used for dynamic player management, and a \texttt{LinkedHashMap} is employed to maintain the order of player rolls during display, ensuring accurate reporting.
\end{itemize}

\section*{3. Robust Features and Scalability}

The project integrates robust features necessary for a functional application:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input Validation and Stability:} Comprehensive input validation is included to gracefully handle invalid user input (e.g., non-numeric choice), preventing runtime crashes and improving user experience.
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Scoreboard and Sorting:} The system executes robust features including a dynamic scoreboard, sorted effectively first by \textbf{wins (descending)} and then by \textbf{player name (alphabetical)} using Java Streams and custom \texttt{Comparators}.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} The modular \texttt{GameEngine} is designed to easily incorporate future enhancements, such as different types of dice (e.g., 8-sided, 10-sided) or expanded game modes, without restructuring the core logic.
\end{itemize}

\section*{4. Code Structure}

The system is organized into a main driver class and three primary component classes for clear separation of responsibility.
